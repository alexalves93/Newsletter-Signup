# Newsletter-Signup-

This is an Express.js app that provides a simple web page to collect user information (first name, last name, and email address). When the user submits the form, their information is sent to Mailchimp's API, which is used for email marketing automation. The response from the Mailchimp API is then used to determine whether the user's information was successfully added to the mailing list. If successful, the user is redirected to a success page, otherwise, they are redirected to a failure page.
